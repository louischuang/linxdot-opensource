This repository is used for install and setup the lorawan services and chirpstacks in Linxdot LD1001/1002 hotspots. We will release some install and running scripts there. Also we would update the new information hers.

##Special Note:##

If you want to use the opensource project on the linxdot LD1001/LD1002 hotspots, you would **LOST** all features of Helium mining progress. It can't be reversed to helium hotspots.Please make sure you want to do that.

Also, This is **volunteer** job and we do not promise everything and you have to take the responsibility by yourself to make suee the hotspot is running well. Of course, we could share the experience on the linxdot-opensouce projects.

OK, let's all. Enjoy yourself!
